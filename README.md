- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @okatoku331
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Futter app development.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Flutter web apps.
-    The reason is that the app I made for iOS cannot pass the Apple Store's review. 
-    I created a fortune telling app and released it on the google play store ,
-    because I was getting requests from iPhone users to make it work on their iPhones as well. 
-    Three times, the Apple Store rejected it, so I gave up on releasing it from the Apple Store.
-    However, since Flutter2 can also be used on the web, 
-    I thought that if I could deploy it as a web app, 
-    iPhone users could also enjoy the app, so I am learning.
